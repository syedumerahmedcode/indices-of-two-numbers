## Objective

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, it should return the indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target. Each input is guaranteed to have exactly one solution, and the same element is not used twice.

For Example

```java
Input

nums = [2, 7, 11, 15]
target = 9

Output

[0, 1]
```
